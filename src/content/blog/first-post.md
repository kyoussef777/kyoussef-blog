Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to lead security integration efforts across multiple cloud environments, and I wanted to share some key insights from this journey.

## The Challenge

When I joined the DevSecOps team at Merck, one of the biggest challenges we faced was the lack of consistent security controls across our Infrastructure as Code (IAC) implementations. Teams were deploying resources with varying levels of security compliance, and we needed a systematic approach to address this gap.

## The Solution: Automated Security Scanning

We integrated an open-source IAC scanner tool that could automatically detect security vulnerabilities and compliance issues in Terraform, CloudFormation, and other infrastructure definitions. This wasn't just about finding problems – it was about building a culture of security-first thinking.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Automation is crucial**: Manual security reviews don't scale. Automated scanning caught 90% of missing guardrails that would have taken weeks to identify manually.

2. **Developer education matters**: We created training programs and user guides to help teams understand not just what to fix, but why these security measures matter.

3. **Visibility drives adoption**: Our operational dashboards showing compliance rates and remediation progress motivated teams to improve their security posture.

The result? A 30% increase in vulnerability remediation rates and much more consistent security practices across our cloud infrastructure.

## Looking Forward

Security isn't a destination – it's an ongoing journey. As we continue to evolve our practices, I'm excited about the potential of AI-assisted security analysis and the integration of security considerations into the earliest stages of the development lifecycle.
